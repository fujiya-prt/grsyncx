- Pick a Source folder or file
- Pick a Destination folder
- Choose other options of the synchronisation
	- All options are marked with tool tips on mouse hover
	- _Preserve extended attributes_ allows keeping your _Finder_ tags in place! 🎨
- Once you're content with the options, you can use the toolbar actions to either Simulate the command run or Execute an actual rsync. 🎉
- Once it's finished, enjoy your backup. 👍
