# grsyncx

Native GUI app for `rsync` inspired by _grsync_. 🔄 As the original _grsync_ app port compiled for _macOS_ used GTK+ and other 32-bit dependencies, it no longer works in _macOS Catalina_ → thus, a replacement must be made! 💪

## How to use

- Open the app
- Pick a Source folder or file
- Pick a Destination folder
- Choose other options of the synchronisation
	- All options are marked with tool tips on mouse hover
	- _Preserve extended attributes_ allows keeping your _Finder_ tags in place! 🎨
- Once you're content with the options, you can use the toolbar actions to either Simulate the command run or Execute an actual rsync. 🎉
- Once it's finished, enjoy your backup. 👍
